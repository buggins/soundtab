Volume is modulated by pen pressure, \r\ninstead of left hand movement in Theremin.\r\n\r\nFor better experience, use Wacom digitizer with pressure detection.\r\n\r\nYou can play with mouse as well, but w/o volume modulation (no pressure information), and less precise positioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported platforms\r\n\r\nCurrently only Windows platform is supported due to used Audio and Wacom Tablet libraries.\r\n\r\nAlthough, it should not be very difficult to port it to Linux / Mac.\r\n\r\n## Download Binaries\r\n\r\nYou can download prebuilt binaries from Releases section on GitHUB.\r\n\r\n        https://github.com/buggins/soundtab/releases\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building Application from Source\r\n\r\nYou will need some D compiler (e.g. DMD or LDC) and DUB utility.\r\n\r\nClone source code from GitHub using git\r\n\r\n        clone https://github.com/buggins/soundtab.git\r\n        \r\n(If you don't have git installed, just download ZIP archive from source code)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter `soundtab` directory.\r\n\r\n        cd soundtab\r\n\r\nInvoke DUB to build and run application.\r\n\r\n        dub run\r\n\r\nYou can find built binaries in soundtab/bin folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Audio Settings\r\n\r\nIn Main Menu, select File/Settings item.\r\n\r\nSelect audio output device, Exclusive/Shared mode, and minimal frame length.\r\n\r\nFor better responsibility (lower latency), check Exclusive mode.\r\n\r\nIf you hear glitches while sound playback, choose bigger value of Minimal Frame Length (milliseconds).\r\n\r\nLowest latency is achievable on Win 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
